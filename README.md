# The 10 Megabyte Manifesto

Version Î²1, by [Dan Turkel](http://danturkel.com/).

## What's this all about?

Read The 10 Megabyte Manifesto [here](http://10mbmanifesto.neocities.org/).

## What's in this repository?

In this repository is the site hosted at 10mbmanifesto.Neocities.org. It's a custom build of [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) which I stripped down to my bare essentials. I also flattened the file structure so that it could be hosted at [Neocities](http://neocities.org).

## How do I contribute?

If you see a minor error, feel free to submit an issue via Github. If you want to change something larger, fork the repo and submit a pull request. If it's a huge change, email me about it at [dan@danturkel.com](mailto:dan@danturkel.com).

## I want to make my own site.

Download the contents of this repo to your desktop, delete my `index.html` file and rename the `template.html` file to `index.html`, read the [Foundation Documentation](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/) and go nuts. If you want to use a piece of Foundation that I didn't include, you can [customize a download here](http://foundation.zurb.com/download.php#customizeFoundation) and then replace the relevant files, most likely `foundation.min.js` and `foundation.min.css`.
